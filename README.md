CS-255-X6345 System Analysis and Design 21EW6

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
A company called DriverPass wanted my company to create a mobile and app version of their site. They wanted the consumer (students of the DMV) to be able to use the test and knowledge at any time during the day. The company wanted students of the DMV to have a place to help them study and take practice test before going to the DMV. 

•	What did you do particularly well?
I would like to say time management, but because of my job I was not able to work on or meet the dates requirements on most of these assignments. I would say what I did well was the research aspect to come up with answers and designs needed to finish my projects.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would create a paid user account to Lucid chart online because I was never able to complete the full designs as Lucid stops you are using the web base site because it limits how many items you add. I would either pay for the full system use or find a program I can use to create the same on my computer. I felt this limited me as I was not able to complete the design scope. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read the users interview and reread it again after to make sure I understood the requirements. After that I read it again and check it against my newly created requirements to see if I meet everything the client requested. It is important to consider the user’s need because the user is the boss. The user is the one that commissioned this program design, so meeting their input is the major requirement. 

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would start by collecting all the requirements I need to produce the software I plan on designing. Next, I would add features that fit the design and create a road map to show how I plan to create this design. Then I would have a friend look it over to see if I missed anything and correct those problems.
